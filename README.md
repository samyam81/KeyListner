# Key Listener Demo

This Java application demonstrates how to implement a key listener using Swing.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

## Instructions

1. Ensure you have JDK installed on your system.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Run the `DemoKeyListener` class.
4. Click on the text area and start typing to see the key events displayed.

## Code Overview

The `DemoKeyListener` class extends `JFrame` and contains a `JTextArea` component to capture key events. It also implements a custom `KeyListener` interface to handle key events.

### Methods

- `keyPressed(KeyEvent e)`: Displays the pressed key in the text area.
- `keyReleased(KeyEvent e)`: Displays the released key in the text area.
- `keyTyped(KeyEvent e)`: Displays the typed key in the text area.

### Main Method

The `main` method initializes an instance of the `DemoKeyListener` class, which starts the application.
